Each month, there is a $200 credit per account

0 - 100,000 queries
$0.005 per query = $5/1000 

100,001 - 500,000 queries
$0.004 per query

2000 queries = $10
20000 queries = $100
40000 queries = $200

So, 40,000 queries a month is free
1333 queries a day stays under the cap
55 queries an hour
Just a little less than one query per minute
